We’re going to see how far we can get in implementing a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items.  

In a normal supermarket, things are identified using Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs. In our store, we’ll use individual letters of the alphabet (A, B, C, and so on). Our goods are priced individually. 

| Item  | Price |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A  | £5.00  |
| B  | £3.00  |
| C  | £2.00  |
| D  | £1.50  |

Our checkout accepts items in any order, so that if we scan a B, an A, and another B, we’ll recognize the two ‘B’s and price them at £6.00 (for a total price so far of £11.00). 

In addition, some items are multi-priced: buy n of them, and they’ll cost you y pounds.

For example, item A might cost £5.00 individually, but this week we have a special offer: buy three ‘A’s and they’ll cost you £13.00
